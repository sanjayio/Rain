Java RPG Game Simulator

This game was inspired from the Nintendo Gameboy Advance's Pokemon game. In this experimental project, I tried to recreate the player movements and tried to bring in those elements and graphics in the Pokemon game to this Java Project. I also learned ways to render the game faster. One of the things things that I learned was to render the tiles only as the player moves to that direction. By doing that I could increase my FPS to a great extent.
